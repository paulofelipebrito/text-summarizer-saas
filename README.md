Great video Josh!

For those building this, an improvement to this is to validate pdf pages on drag enter or click upload and show the error state in the upload input. 

Or you could show a message on each upload on the free tier stating that even if they upload a pdf with more than 5 pages only the first five pages will be accepted 

The second option is more user friendly and would probably work better.
